# Prayer points
If you would consider yourself a Christian and would like to know how you can be praying for the CU, here are some pointers:

- Pray for those taking exams or doing projects, that they will have energy and find rest in the Lord
- Pray for final year students who will soon be graduating, that God would grant them wisdom and guidance about their next steps
- Pray for the committee as they plan events for the rest of the term and next year
- Pray for our city in the wake of the attacks, and the country in the run up to the general election

In Christ,
